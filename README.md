# Bikesharing

## Overview of the Project
The intent of this project was to show potential investors how a potential bike sharing program would work in a city based off of information form a similar venture in NYC.

## Results
### Checkout times for user

Looking at this chart for checkout times for users, it shows that the majority of rides lasted no longer than 20 minutes. This shows us that there would have to be a large quantity of bikes to fill a demand since bikes aren't used for very long periods. On the plus side, it may keep repair costs down since the rides are not in fact lengthy.

### Checkout times by Gender

In this graph, we can see that the main user of this service is male, by way more than double that of females and the unkown category. The rides themselves also tend to have a longer average. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This data clearly shows us that the service is most used by people to commute to and from work, with much more usage occuring after work hours. Saturday early afternoon, through early evening also shows a high usage.

### Trips by Gender

As before, the males show to be the majority user of this service, with the highest usage occuring during the commute times.

The amount of male subscribers would show us to believe that they rely on this system more than any of the other genders. 

### Top starting Locations

Looking at this chart, we can see that the main usage comes from downtown Manhattan. With that in mind, it would be safe to say that most of the rentals would occur in other more densley populated cities, as opposed to more rural areas.

### Customer Type

Of the 2.3 million points of data, or times this service was used. More than 80% of the time it was down so by subscribers. Showing us that there may be room to improve on attracting more casual users to the service.
